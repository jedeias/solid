# Simple CRUD using PHP and MySQL

This is a simple CRUD project developed in PHP 7.4.19 and MySQL 5.7.33, created with the purpose of learning the SOLID principles and MVC architecture.

## Technologies Used

- PHP 7.4.19
- MySQL 5.7.33

## Features

- Create: Allows creating new records in the database.
- Read: Enables reading and displaying existing records.
- Update: Provides the ability to update existing records.
- Delete: Allows deleting records from the database.

## Concepts Explored

### SOLID Principles

This project focuses on applying the SOLID principles, which stand for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or component should have only one responsibility.
- **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### MVC Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the business logic and data handling.
- **View**: Handles the user interface and presentation.
- **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the Model and the View, processing user requests and updating the Model or View accordingly.
